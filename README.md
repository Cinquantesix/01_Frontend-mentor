## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

It was my first project with github, so I learn a lot about HTML/CSS/JS but also with VScode and github. What I tried during the process:

- Learn more about Grid and placement
- Try to forget a bit about jQueries to learn more about vanilla JS

### Continued development

I think sometimes, I don't take the "easy way" to solve the situationâ€¦ I, maybe, rebuild three or four time my CSS to be sure that it will work in any case. So I need to learn more about a better way to approach. 

For the JS, I understand what the code make, but I need to be able to start this kind of code from scratch (like I do in jQueries).
